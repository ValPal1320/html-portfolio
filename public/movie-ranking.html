<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>
    This movie has been my favorite ever since I can remember. Sometimes I wish the spirit world exists so I can escape reality once in a while.

<h3>Batman (2022)</h3>
<p>
    Love how they showcase Batman to be a "detective" instead of your typical superhero.

<h3>Elf</h3>
<p>
    My favorite movie to watch during Christmas time. It's a feel-good movie and makes me laugh every time.
